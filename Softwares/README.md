# Software Installation Guide

## Step 1: Python Installation üêç

Begin by downloading and installing Python, ensuring a smooth integration with your development environment. We recommend Python version 3.8.2 or higher for optimal compatibility.

[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Or utilize the [Python 3.8.2 Web Installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-webinstall.exe) for a streamlined installation process.

## Step 2: Verification of Python Installation üìä

Open the Command Prompt and execute the following command to confirm the installed Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

Review the output to ensure the correct Python version is displayed.
